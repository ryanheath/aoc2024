Advent of code 2024

Totally ready for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024!<br>
Last year, I've decided to document my journey on GitHub just for the kicks.<br>
This year, I'll continue. Just for the kicks. ðŸŽ„ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 1
<img src="Day1.webp" alt="Day 1 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Traditionally, this one was easy ðŸ™‚

## Day 2
<img src="Day2.webp" alt="Day 2 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Still easy-peasy. Don't forget the wrong value can be one earlier than you think ðŸ˜‰

## Day 3
Horrors of previous years flashed before my eyes, so I went to long type immediately!
