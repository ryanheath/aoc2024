# aoc2024
Advent of code 2024

Totally ready for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024!<br>
Last year, I've decided to document my journey on GitHub just for the kicks.<br>
This year, I'll continue. Just for the kicks. 🎄😎<br>

### How to run
You need to provide your own puzzle inputs. Aoc doesn't allow sharing of one's own input.<br>
Create a DayX.txt file for each day at the root of the project.

- Run from command line: dotnet run
- Run from your favorite dotnet core IDE

## Day 1
<img src="Day1.webp" alt="Day 1 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Traditionally, this one was easy 🙂

## Day 2
<img src="Day2.webp" alt="Day 2 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Still easy-peasy. Don't forget the wrong value can be one earlier than you think 😉

## Day 3
<img src="Day3.webp" alt="Day 3 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Horrors of previous years flashed before my eyes, so I went to long type immediately!<br>
Wasted a lot of time, because the second input example was not the same as the first! 😅

## Day 4
<img src="Day4.webp" alt="Day 4 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
TraverseDiagonalBackwards ...

## Day 5
<img src="Day5.webp" alt="Day 5 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
IComparer Sort RuLeS!

## Day 6
<img src="Day6.webp" alt="Day 6 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy part 1. Part 2: I just knew we must detect loops!

## Day 7
<img src="Day7.webp" alt="Day 7 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Not too difficult, but some reason I got stuck on a <= test instead of a <<br>
For Part 2 I just knew we would have a || operator seeing example 156: 15 6

## Day 8
<img src="Day8.webp" alt="Day 8 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy day, nothing special, suspiciously ...

## Day 9
<img src="Day9.webp" alt="Day 9 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Flashbacks of Norton disk defragmenter 😆
Wasted too much time moving files too the right 🤦‍♂️
For part 2, totally moved files leave an empty space ...

## Day 10
<img src="Day10.webp" alt="Day 10 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy day? Yep, even part 2 😆

## Day 11
<img src="Day11.webp" alt="Day 11 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
When I read exception message "The input string '-' was not in a correct format" I knew I needed to switch to long ...<br>
Part 2 was fun dynamic programming 😅

## Day 12
<img src="Day12.webp" alt="Day 12 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy day, again? Part 2 looked like parsing the regions.

## Day 13
<img src="Day13.webp" alt="Day 13 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 is a nice variation of math problem of Day 7<br>
The solution is just solving two equations! 🙈

## Day 14
<img src="Day14.webp" alt="Day 14 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 was easy, using a previous AoC method PositiveMod<br>
Part 2: form a christmas tree? What?

## Day 15
<img src="Day15.webp" alt="Day 15 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Problem description sounds familiar ...<br>
Sokoban vibes!

## Day 16
<img src="Day16.webp" alt="Day 16 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Day 10 comes in handy! Simple map traversing.

## Day 17
<img src="Day17.webp" alt="Day 17 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 was fun and easy. Part2, I really don't have a clue ...

## Day 18
<img src="Day18.webp" alt="Day 18 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 reused Day 10

## Day 19
<img src="Day19.webp" alt="Day 19 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Don't forget to also remember what does not match ...

## Day 20
<img src="Day20.webp" alt="Day 20 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 is easy. For part 2 I wasted so much time on wrong example cheat sums.<br>
I really needed to use the calculator instead of my head ... 😅

## Day 21
<img src="Day21.webp" alt="Day 21 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Oof 🫠

## Day 22
<img src="Day22.webp" alt="Day 21 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Part 1 is easy, as long as you use long.

## Day 23
<img src="Day23.webp" alt="Day 23 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Starts with t, not Contains t ...

## Day 24
<img src="Day24.webp" alt="Day 24 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Suddenly the story is 'at the edge of a large grove somewhere in the jungle' ... 😝

## Day 25
<img src="Day25.webp" alt="Day 25 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Traditionally, this one was easy 🙂
