Advent of code 2024

Totally ready for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024!<br>
Last year, I've decided to document my journey on GitHub just for the kicks.<br>
This year, I'll continue. Just for the kicks. 🎄😎

## Day 1

Traditionally, this one was easy 🙂

## Day 2
<img src="Day2.webp" alt="Day 2 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Still easy-peasy. Don't forget the wrong value can be one earlier than you think 😉

## Day 3
<img src="Day3.webp" alt="Day 3 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Horrors of previous years flashed before my eyes, so I went to long type immediately!<br>
Wasted a lot of time, because the second input example was not the same as the first! 😅

## Day 4
<img src="Day4.webp" alt="Day 4 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
TraverseDiagonalBackwards ...

## Day 5
<img src="Day5.webp" alt="Day 5 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
IComparer Sort RuLeS!

## Day 6
<img src="Day6.webp" alt="Day 6 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy part 1. Part 2: I just knew we must detect loops!

## Day 7
<img src="Day7.webp" alt="Day 7 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Not too difficult, but some reason I got stuck on a <= test instead of a <<br>
For Part 2 I just knew we would have a || operator seeing example 156: 15 6

## Day 8
<img src="Day8.webp" alt="Day 8 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Easy-peasy day, nothing special, suspiciously ...

## Day 9
<img src="Day9.webp" alt="Day 9 - *Image generated by DALL-E 2*" width="400"/><br>
Flashbacks of Norton disk defragmenter 😆
Wasted too much time moving files too the right 🤦‍♂️
For part 2, totally moved files leave an empty space ...
